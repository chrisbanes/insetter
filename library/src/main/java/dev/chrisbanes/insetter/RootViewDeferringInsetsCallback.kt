/**
 * A class which extends/implements both [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat.Callback] and
 * [View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener], which should be set on the root view in your layout.
 *
 * This class enables the root view is selectively defer handling any insets which match
 * [deferredInsetTypes], to enable better looking [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat]s.
 *
 * An example is the following: when a [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat] is started, the system will dispatch
 * a [WindowInsetsCompat] instance which contains the end state of the animation. For the scenario of
 * the IME being animated in, that means that the insets contains the IME height. If the view's
 * [View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener] simply always applied the combination of
 * [WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime] and [WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars] using padding, the viewport of any
 * child views would then be smaller. This results in us animating a smaller (padded-in) view into
 * a larger viewport. Visually, this results in the views looking clipped.
 *
 * This class allows us to implement a different strategy for the above scenario, by selectively
 * deferring the [WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime] insets until the [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat] is ended.
 * For the above example, you would create a [RootViewDeferringInsetsCallback] like so:
 *
 * ```
 * val callback = RootViewDeferringInsetsCallback(
 *     persistentInsetTypes = WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars(),
 *     deferredInsetTypes = WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime()
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * This class is not limited to just IME animations, and can work with any [WindowInsetsCompat.Type]s.
 *
 * @param persistentInsetTypes the bitmask of any inset types which should always be handled
 * through padding the attached view
 * @param deferredInsetTypes the bitmask of insets types which should be deferred until after
 * any related [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat]s have ended
