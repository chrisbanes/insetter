# Insetter

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.chrisbanes.insetter/insetter)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:dev.chrisbanes.insetter)

Insetter is a library to help apps handle
[WindowInsets](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowInsets.html) more easily.
The library contains implementations of many of the concepts described in our
[_"Listeners to Layouts"_](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/windowinsets-listeners-to-layouts-8f9ccc8fa4d1)
blog post.

There are a number of libraries available:

### [insetter](library/)

The base library which provides an easy-to-use
[Builder](/library/src/main/java/dev/chrisbanes/insetter/Insetter.kt) for
[OnApplyWindowInsetsListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/OnApplyWindowInsetsListener)
instances:

``` java
 Insetter.builder()
     // This will apply the system window insets as padding to left, bottom and right of the view,
     // maintaining the original padding (from the layout XML, style, etc)
     .applySystemWindowInsetsToPadding(Side.LEFT | Side.BOTTOM | Side.RIGHT)
     // This is a shortcut for view.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(builder.build())
     .applyToView(view);
```

It also provides some extension functions allowing easy access to the library functions:

``` kotlin
bottomNav.applySystemWindowInsetsToPadding(bottom = true)
btnConfirm.applySystemWindowInsetsToMargin(bottom = true, right = true)
```

### [insetter-dbx](dbx/)

A [Data Binding][databinding] extension library, providing [Data Binding][databinding] specific functionality.
This primarily contains binding adapters, which allow access to the helper functions from your layouts:

``` xml
<BottomNavigationView
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:paddingVertical="24dp"
    app:paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets="@{true}"
    app:paddingLeftSystemWindowInsets="@{true}" />
```

üìñ You can read more information [here](dbx/).

### [insetter-widgets](widgets/)

An extension library which provides versions of commonly used ViewGroups with enhanced inset
handling. Currently this library is focusing on building upon 
[ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout.html).

A example of a widget is [InsetterConstraintLayout](widgets/src/main/java/dev/chrisbanes/insetter/widgets/constraintlayout/InsetterConstraintLayout.java),
which enables new attributes to define inset behavior on child views.
The behavior enabled through `InsetterConstraintLayout` is similar to that provided by 
the `insetter-dbx` library, but without the requirement of using data-binding.

``` xml
<dev.chrisbanes.insetter.widgets.constraintlayout.InsetterConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <ImageView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:paddingSystemWindowInsets="left|top|right|bottom"
        android:src="@drawable/rectangle" />

</dev.chrisbanes.insetter.widgets.constraintlayout.InsetterConstraintLayout>
```

üìñ You can read more information [here](widgets/).

### insetter-ktx

The old `insetter-ktx` library has now removed, as all of the KTX funtions have been moved to the main [library](library/). You can safely remove any references to the `insetter-ktx` dependency, and replace it with the core library.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention üöß

The library is being written to production quality, but it is not adhering to semantic versioning,
mean we may change the API if needed, though we'll try not to. We're using this repository to
allow quick and easy prototyping. The contents of this library may eventually be moved into
[Android Jetpack](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-master-dev/README.md)
at a later date.

## Download
![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.chrisbanes.insetter/insetter)

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // The base library. If you're using either the dbx and/or ktx libraries, you don't need this
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.insetter:insetter:<latest version>"

    // If you're using data-binding use this
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.insetter:insetter-dbx:<latest version>"
  
    // If you would like to use the enhanced widget set, use this
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.insetter:insetter-widgets:<latest version>"
}
```
