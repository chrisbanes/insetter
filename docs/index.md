# Insetter

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.chrisbanes.insetter/insetter)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:dev.chrisbanes.insetter)

Insetter is a library to help apps handle
[WindowInsets](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowInsets) more easily.
The library contains implementations of many of the concepts described in our
[_"Listeners to Layouts"_](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/windowinsets-listeners-to-layouts-8f9ccc8fa4d1)
blog post.

There are a number of libraries available:

### [Main library](library/)

The main library provides simple APIs for handling [WindowInsets](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowInsets):

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    view.applyInsetter {
        // Apply the navigation bar insets...
        type(navigationBars = true) {
            // Add to padding on all sides
            padding()
        }
    }
    ```

=== "Java"

    ``` java
    Insetter.builder()
        // This will add the navigation bars insets as padding to all sides of the view,
        // maintaining the original padding (from the layout XML, style, etc)
        .padding(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.navigationBars())
        // This is a shortcut for view.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(builder.build())
        .applyToView(view);
    ```

üìñ You can read more information [here](library/).

### [Data-binding extensions (DBX)](dbx/)

A [Data Binding][databinding] extension library, providing [Data Binding][databinding] specific functionality.
This primarily contains binding adapters, which allow access to the helper functions from your layouts:

``` xml
<BottomNavigationView
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:paddingVertical="24dp"
    app:paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets="@{true}"
    app:paddingLeftSystemWindowInsets="@{true}" />
```

üìñ You can read more information [here](dbx/).

### [Widgets](widgets/)

An extension library which provides versions of commonly used ViewGroups with enhanced inset
handling. Currently this library is focusing on building upon 
[`ConstraintLayout`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout.html).

A example of a widget is [InsetterConstraintLayout][icl],
which enables new attributes to define inset behavior on child views:

``` xml
<dev.chrisbanes.insetter.widgets.constraintlayout.InsetterConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <ImageView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:paddingSystemWindowInsets="left|top|right|bottom"
        android:src="@drawable/rectangle" />

</dev.chrisbanes.insetter.widgets.constraintlayout.InsetterConstraintLayout>
```

üìñ You can read more information [here](widgets/).

### insetter-ktx

The old `insetter-ktx` library has now removed, as all of the KTX functions have been moved to the main [library](library/). You can safely remove any references to the `insetter-ktx` dependency, and replace it with the core library.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention üöß

The library is being written to production quality, but it is not adhering to semantic versioning,
mean we may change the API if needed, though we'll try not to. We're using this repository to
allow quick and easy prototyping. The contents of this library may eventually be moved into
[Android Jetpack](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-master-dev/)
at a later date.
