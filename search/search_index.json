The library contains implementations of many of the concepts described in our \"Listeners to Layouts\" blog post. There are a number of libraries available: Main library \u00b6 The main library provides simple APIs for handling WindowInsets : Kotlin view . applyInsetter { // Apply the navigation bar insets... type ( navigationBars = true ) { // Add to padding on all sides padding () } } Java Insetter . builder () // This will add the navigation bars insets as padding to all sides of the view, // maintaining the original padding (from the layout XML, style, etc) . padding ( WindowInsetsCompat . Type . navigationBars ()) // This is a shortcut for view.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(builder.build()) . applyToView ( view ); \ud83d\udcd6 You can read more information here . Data-binding extensions (DBX) \u00b6 A Data Binding extension library, providing Data Binding specific functionality. This primarily contains binding adapters, which allow access to the helper functions from your layouts: <BottomNavigationView android:layout_height= \"wrap_content\" android:layout_width= \"match_parent\" android:paddingVertical= \"24dp\" app:paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets= \"@{true}\" app:paddingLeftSystemWindowInsets= \"@{true}\" /> \ud83d\udcd6 You can read more information here . Widgets \u00b6 The old insetter-widgets library has now removed. View binding + improvements to the main library mean that it now simple to use the main library only. insetter-ktx \u00b6 The old insetter-ktx library has now removed, as all of the KTX functions have been moved to the main library . You can safely remove any references to the insetter-ktx dependency, and replace it with the core library. \u26a0\ufe0f Attention \ud83d\udea7 \u00b6 The library is being written to production quality, but it is not adhering to semantic versioning, mean we may change the API if needed, though we'll try not to. We're using this repository to allow quick and easy prototyping. The contents of this library may eventually be moved into Android Jetpack at a later date. Contributions \u00b6 Please contribute!

This primarily contains binding adapters, which allow access to the helper functions from your layouts. Currently the attributes provided are: Warning The future for the DBX library is currently being evaluated. It's unclear how useful it is, and the amount of effort needed to update it to the new WindowInsets types is great. View binding + improvements to the main library mean that it now simple to use the main library only. Applying system window insets \u00b6 The following attributes are useful in being able to apply the system window insets insets, to specific dimensions to views. app:paddingLeftSystemWindowInsets : to apply the left dimension to the view's paddingLeft . app:paddingTopSystemWindowInsets : to apply the top dimension to the view's paddingTop . app:paddingRightSystemWindowInsets : to apply the right dimension to the view's paddingRight . app:paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets : to apply the bottom dimension to the view's paddingBottom . app:layout_marginLeftSystemWindowInsets : to apply the left dimension to the view's layout_marginLeft . app:layout_marginTopSystemWindowInsets : to apply the top dimension to the view's layout_marginTop . app:layout_marginRightSystemWindowInsets : to apply the right dimension to the view's layout_marginRight . app:layout_marginBottomSystemWindowInsets : to apply the bottom dimension to the view's layout_marginBottom . consumeSystemWindowInsets : whether to consume the system window insets. Defaults to false . Applying system gesture insets \u00b6 The following attributes are useful in being able to apply the system gesture insets insets, to specific dimensions to views. app:paddingLeftSystemGestureInsets : to apply the left dimension to the view's paddingLeft . app:paddingTopSystemGestureInsets : to apply the top dimension to the view's paddingTop . app:paddingRightSystemGestureInsets : to apply the right dimension to the view's paddingRight . app:paddingBottomSystemGestureInsets : to apply the bottom dimension to the view's paddingBottom . app:layout_marginLeftSystemGestureInsets : to apply the left dimension to the view's layout_marginLeft . app:layout_marginTopSystemGestureInsets : to apply the top dimension to the view's layout_marginTop . app:layout_marginRightSystemGestureInsets : to apply the right dimension to the view's layout_marginRight . app:layout_marginBottomSystemGestureInsets : to apply the bottom dimension to the view's layout_marginBottom . Using the applying insets attributes \u00b6 Each of the attributes takes a boolean value of whether the attribute functionality is enabled or not, like so: <ImageView app:paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets= \"@{true}\" app:paddingLeftSystemWindowInsets= \"@{true}\" /> You can use any non-exclusive combination of insets and application type, such as the following which uses the bottom system window inset for padding, and the left gesture inset for margin: <ImageView app:paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets= \"@{true}\" app:layout_marginLeftSystemGestureInsets= \"@{true}\" /> Compound padding/margin \u00b6 You can safely set any padding or margins on the view, and the values will be maintained. For example here we're using a padding of 24dp , and also applying the system window insets left and bottom using padding: <ImageView app:paddingLeftSystemWindowInsets= \"@{true}\" app:paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets= \"@{true}\" android:padding= \"24dp\" /> If the bottom system window insets is defined as 48dp on the device, the final applied padding for the view will be: Dimension Layout padding System window insets Final applied padding Left 24dp 0dp 24dp Top 24dp 0dp 24dp (0 + 24) Right 24dp 0dp 24dp Bottom 24dp 48dp 72dp (24 + 48) The same behavior happens when using margin too. Edge-to-edge attributes \u00b6 There is currently just one edge-to-edge attribute: app:layout_edgeToEdge : Set this view's system-ui visibility with the flags required to be laid out 'edge-to-edge', or not. <FrameLayout xmlns:android= \"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" xmlns:app= \"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\" android:layout_width= \"match_parent\" android:layout_height= \"match_parent\" app:layout_edgeToEdge= \"@{true}\" > <!-- Yadda yadda --> </FrameLayout> Download \u00b6 Stable Latest version: repositories { mavenCentral () } dependencies { implementation \"dev.chrisbanes.insetter:insetter-dbx:<latest version>\" } Snapshot Snapshots of the current development version are available, which track the latest commit.
